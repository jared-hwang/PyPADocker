README for pygist-1.5/src
-------------------------

Part of this directory were abstracted from the full yorick distribution.
Specifically, the gist and play subdirectories and the configure/build
structure.  (work done by Dave Munro)

The work in this directory does three things for pygist:

- Makes libpyg.a for the shared library gistCmodule.so.

- Installs the yorick palette and style files (in subdirectory g)
  in the user-specified site-independent Y_SITE directory.

- Installs the gist browser in a site-dependent YHOME directory.
  For simplicity, can choose Y_SITE = Y_HOME.

Changes need to yorick sources required:
----------------------------------------
See yorick.changes.

- We only change play/unix/ugetc.c for pygist.

Original Installation Process 
-----------------------------
(Things are now handled in top-level setup.py; comments below preserved
for understanding.)

Suppose everything is to be installed in /usr/apps/python/opt. 
The instructions would then be:

   setenv PYTHONHOME /usr/apps/python/opt
   make ysite Y_SITE=${PYTHONHOME}
       (some scripting is echoed to the terminal)
   make config
   make 
   make install 

   cd ..

After this is done, return to the main directory (pygist-1.5) to 
perform the Python module installation.
