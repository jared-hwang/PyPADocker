This directory contains code that works around bugs on single
platforms I consider to be important enough to not insist that yorick
will not run until the vendor repairs the bug.  Yorick source code
contains numerous places where the source has been tweaked slightly to
work around minor bugs (that is, non-compliance to either ANSI or
POSIX standards, or just compiler or library errors).  In many more
instances, an expert can set compiler flags to build a correct yorick
on platforms where the default settings tickle such bugs.

Finally, with the release of MacOS X 10.3, there is a bug that cannot
be handled by anything short of wholesale hacking, that actually will
work only on that individual platform, causing harm elsewhere (even on
MacOS X 10.2 or 10.1).  The top level file MacOS103.bug in this tree
describes the bug.  Here is the code to partly fix it, engineered in
such a way that any future similar hacks could use it as well.
