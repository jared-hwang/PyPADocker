/** \brief Abstract interface of a local assembler for integral operators.

  Let \f$A\f$ be an integral boundary operator. A local assembler associated
  with this operator constructs matrices \f$A_{mn}\f$, where \f$m\f$ is a test
  element number and \f$n\f$ a trial element number, with entries
  \f$(A_{mn})_{ij} = (u_{mi}, A v_{nj}\f$) where \f$(\cdot, \cdot)\f$ is the
  standard scalar product, \f$(u_{mi})_{i=1}^m\f$ are the element-level test
  functions defined on element \f$m\f$ and \f$(v_{nj})_{j=1}^n\f$ are the
  element-level trial functions defined on element \f$n\f$.

  The local assembler is responsible for choosing an appropriate way of
  evaluating
  the necessary integrals. */
