/**
 * \ingroup grid_internal
 * \brief Take a vector and interpret it as point data for the VTKWriter
 *
 * This class turns a generic vector containing point data into a
 * VTKFunction.  The vector must allow read access to the data via
 * operator[]() and store the data in the order given by
 * MultipleCodimMultipleGeomTypeMapper with a layout class that allows only
 * vertices.  Also, it must support the method size().
 *
 * As opposed to a <tt>Dune::P1VTKFunction</tt>, this class represents all
 * components of a vector field at once.
 *
 * \note While this function may be evaluated anywhere on a given grid
 *       element, it does not interpolate between the corners of the element
 *       -- instead, it returns the value at the nearest corner (as
 *       determined in local coordinates).
 *
 * \tparam GV Type of GridView the vector applies to.
 * \tparam V  Type of vector.
