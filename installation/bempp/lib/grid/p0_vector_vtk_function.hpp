 * VTKFunction.  The vector must allow read access to the data via
 * operator[]() and store the data in the order given by
 * MultipleCodimMultipleGeomTypeMapper with a layout class that allows only
 * elements.  Also, it must support the method size().
 *
 * As opposed to a <tt>Dune::P0VTKFunction</tt>, this class represents all
 * components of a vector field at once.
 *
 * \tparam GV Type of GridView the vector applies to.
