/** \defgroup maxwell_3d Maxwell equations in 3D
    \ingroup operators

    This submodule contains classes relevant to the implementation of boundary
    operators and potential operators related to the time-harmonic Maxwell
    equations in 3D. Inside a region with a uniform scalar permittivity and
    permeability, these equations can be reduced to the form

    \f[
        \boldsymbol\nabla \times \boldsymbol\nabla \times
        \boldsymbol u - k^2 \boldsymbol u = 0,
    \f]

    where \f$\boldsymbol u\f$ stands either for the electric or the magnetic
    field and the number \f$k \neq 0\f$ is referred to as the <em>wave
    number</em>.

    The treatment of Maxwell equations in BEM++ closely follows that of A. Buffa
    and R. Hiptmair, "Galerkin Boundary Element Methods for Electromagnetic
    Scattering", in "Computational Methods in Wave Propagation", M. Ainsworth,
    ed., Springer, New York 2003, pp. 85-126. In the following we cite the
    principal definitions relevant to the implementation of BEM in the Maxwell
    case.

    The starting point is the Stratton-Chu theorem (Theorem 6 in Buffa and
    Hiptmair), which plays a part analogous to the Green's representation
    theorem for the Laplace equation. It states that any solution \f$u\f$ of the
    Maxwell equations in a bounded domain \f$\Omega\f$ with boundary
    \f$\Gamma\f$ has the representation

    \f[ \boldsymbol u =
    \boldsymbol \Psi_{\mathrm{SL}}(\gamma_{\mathrm{N,int}}\boldsymbol u) +
    \boldsymbol \Psi_{\mathrm{DL}}(\gamma_{\mathrm{D,int}}\boldsymbol u).
    \f]

    (all the symbols will be defined shortly). Furthermore, any solution \f$u\f$
    that satisfies the Maxwell equations in a domain \f$\Omega^{\mathrm c}\f$
    extending to infinity and meets the Silver-Mueller radiation conditions at
    infinity has the representation

    \f[ \boldsymbol u =
    -\boldsymbol \Psi_{\mathrm{SL}}(\gamma_{\mathrm{N,ext}}\boldsymbol u) -
    \boldsymbol \Psi_{\mathrm{DL}}(\gamma_{\mathrm{D,ext}}\boldsymbol u).
    \f]

    The action of the <em>single-layer potential operator</em> is defined by

    \f[
    (\boldsymbol \Psi_{\mathrm{SL}} \boldsymbol v)(\boldsymbol x) \equiv
    \mathrm i k \int_{\Gamma} G(\boldsymbol x, \boldsymbol y)
    \boldsymbol v(\boldsymbol y) \mathrm\Gamma(\boldsymbol y) -
    \frac{1}{\mathrm i k}
    \boldsymbol\nabla_{\boldsymbol x}
    \int_{\Gamma} G(\boldsymbol x, \boldsymbol y)
    (\boldsymbol \nabla_\Gamma \cdot \boldsymbol v)(\boldsymbol y)
    \mathrm\Gamma(\boldsymbol y),
    \f]

    where

    \f[
    G(\boldsymbol x, \boldsymbol y) \equiv
    \frac{\exp(\mathrm i k \lvert \boldsymbol x - \boldsymbol y \rvert)}
    {4\pi \lvert \boldsymbol x - \boldsymbol y \rvert}
    \f]

    is the Green's function of the Helmholtz equation. The action of the
    <em>double-layer potential operator</em>, in turn, is defined by
    \f[
    (\Psi_{\mathrm{DL}} \boldsymbol v)(\boldsymbol x) \equiv
    \boldsymbol\nabla_{\boldsymbol x} \times
    \int_{\Gamma} G(\boldsymbol x, \boldsymbol y)
    \boldsymbol v(\boldsymbol y) \mathrm\Gamma(\boldsymbol y).
    \f]

    The <em>interior Dirichlet trace</em> \f$\gamma_{\mathrm{D,int}}\boldsymbol
    u\f$ at a point \f$\boldsymbol x \in \Gamma\f$ is defined as

    \f[(\gamma_{\mathrm{D,int}}\boldsymbol u)(\boldsymbol x) \equiv
    \boldsymbol u\rvert_{\Gamma,\mathrm{int}}(\boldsymbol x) \times
    \boldsymbol n(\boldsymbol x),\f]

    where \f$\boldsymbol n\f$
    is the outward unit vector normal to \f$\Gamma\f$ at \f$\boldsymbol x\f$ and
    \f$\boldsymbol u\rvert_{\Gamma,\mathrm{int}}(\boldsymbol x)\f$
    is the limit of \f$\boldsymbol u(\boldsymbol y)\f$ as
    \f$\boldsymbol y\f$ approaches \f$\boldsymbol x\f$
    from within \f$\Omega\f$.
    The <em>interior Neumann trace</em> \f$\gamma_{\mathrm{N,int}}\boldsymbol
    u\f$ at \f$\boldsymbol x \in \Gamma\f$ is defined as

    \f[(\gamma_{\mathrm{N,int}}\boldsymbol u)(\boldsymbol x) \equiv
    \frac{1}{\mathrm i k}
    (\boldsymbol \nabla \times \boldsymbol u)\rvert_{\Gamma,\mathrm{int}}
    (\boldsymbol x) \times
    \boldsymbol n(\boldsymbol x).\f]

    Note that compared to Buffa and Hiptmair, we include an additional
    \f$\mathrm i\f$ factor in the denominator of the Neumann trace and in the
    numerator of the single-layer potential operator, as this makes both
    quantities real-valued in the special case of \f$k\f$ purely imaginary (and
    \f$\boldsymbol u\f$ purely real).

    The <em>exterior</em> Dirichlet and Neumann traces are defined analogously,
    with the relevant quantities assumed to approach the point \f$\boldsymbol
    x\f$ from within the complement of \f$\Omega\f$.

    The <em>single-layer boundary operator</em>
    \f$\boldsymbol S\f$ is defined as the average of the interior and exterior
    Dirichlet traces of the single-layer potential operator:

    \f[
    \boldsymbol S =
    \frac12
    (\gamma_{\mathrm{D,int}} \boldsymbol \Psi_{\mathrm{SL}} +
    \gamma_{\mathrm{D,ext}} \boldsymbol \Psi_{\mathrm{SL}}).
    \f]

    The <em>double-layer boundary operator</em> \f$\boldsymbol C\f$ is defined,
    analogously, as the average of the interior and exterior Dirichlet traces of
    the double-layer potential operator.

    To exploit the symmetry between the electric and magnetic field in Maxwell
    equations, it is advantageous to use the following antisymmetric
    pseudo-inner product in the Galerkin discretisation of the above boundary
    operators:

    \f[
    \langle \boldsymbol u, \boldsymbol v \rangle_{\boldsymbol\tau,\Gamma} \equiv
    \int_\Gamma \boldsymbol u^* \cdot (\boldsymbol v \times \boldsymbol n)
    \mathrm d\Gamma,
    \f]

    where \f$*\f$ denotes complex conjugation. The weak forms of the single- and
    double-layer boundary operators with respect to this pseudo-inner product
    are given by

    \f[
    \langle \boldsymbol u,
    \boldsymbol S \boldsymbol v\rangle_{\boldsymbol\tau,\Gamma} =
    \int_\Gamma \int_\Gamma
    G(\boldsymbol x, \boldsymbol y)
    \biggl[-\mathrm i k
    \boldsymbol u^*(\boldsymbol x) \cdot \boldsymbol v(\boldsymbol y)
    -\frac{1}{\mathrm i k}
    (\boldsymbol \nabla_\Gamma \cdot \boldsymbol u^*)(\boldsymbol x)
    (\boldsymbol \nabla_\Gamma \cdot \boldsymbol v)(\boldsymbol y)
    \biggr]
    \mathrm{d}\Gamma(\boldsymbol x)\,\mathrm{d}\Gamma(\boldsymbol y)
    \f]

    and

    \f[
    \langle \boldsymbol u,
    \boldsymbol C \boldsymbol v\rangle_{\boldsymbol\tau,\Gamma} =
    \int_\Gamma \int_\Gamma
    \boldsymbol\nabla_{\boldsymbol x}G(\boldsymbol x, \boldsymbol y) \cdot
    [\boldsymbol u^*(\boldsymbol x) \times \boldsymbol v(\boldsymbol y)]
    \mathrm{d}\Gamma(\boldsymbol x)\,\mathrm{d}\Gamma(\boldsymbol y).
    \f]

    Solution of particular Maxwell problems relies on the following boundary
    integral equations imposed on \f$\Gamma\f$:

    \f{align*}{
    \biggl(-\frac12 \boldsymbol I + \boldsymbol C_{\mathrm{int}}\biggr)
    \gamma_{\mathrm{D,int}}\boldsymbol u +
    \boldsymbol S_{\mathrm{int}} \gamma_{\mathrm{N,int}}\boldsymbol u &= 0 \\
    -\boldsymbol S_{\mathrm{int}} \gamma_{\mathrm{D,int}}\boldsymbol u +
    \biggl(-\frac12 \boldsymbol I + \boldsymbol C_{\mathrm{int}}\biggr)
    \gamma_{\mathrm{N,int}}\boldsymbol u &= 0 \\
    \biggl(\frac12 \boldsymbol I + \boldsymbol C_{\mathrm{ext}}\biggr)
    \gamma_{\mathrm{D,ext}}\boldsymbol u +
    \boldsymbol S_{\mathrm{ext}} \gamma_{\mathrm{N,ext}}\boldsymbol u &= 0 \\
    -\boldsymbol S_{\mathrm{ext}} \gamma_{\mathrm{D,ext}}\boldsymbol u +
    \biggl(\frac12 \boldsymbol I + \boldsymbol C_{\mathrm{ext}}\biggr)
    \gamma_{\mathrm{N,ext}}\boldsymbol u &= 0.
    \f}

    Here, the symbol \f$\boldsymbol I\f$ denotes the identity operator. It is
    crucial to remember that the weak forms of \f$\boldsymbol S\f$ and
    \f$\boldsymbol C\f$ are defined with respect to the pseudo-inner product
    rather than the standard sesquilinear inner product. Thus, in practical
    implementation an operator whose weak form represents the identity operator
    under the pseudo-inner product is indispensable. Such an operator is
    provided by the Maxwell3dIdentityOperator class.
