Pickle basic writer class PR by David Grote, LLNL
Heavily modified from PR.py originally written by Paul Dubois, LLNL, to use
pickle files.

This provides a nice wrapper over pickles for reading general
self-describing data sets written out with PWpickle.PW.

Access to data in the file is available via attributes. For example, to get
the value of x from a file, do the following...

ff = PR(filename)
x = ff.x

There is also the read method
x = ff.read('x')
which is useful for names that are not usable as python attributes.
