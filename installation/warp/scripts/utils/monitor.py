"""
Sets up a remote run monitor. To use, first create the monitor in the
running job by inserting the following command somewhere in the input deck
before the long running commands:

createmonitor(passwd='mypassword')

Then, from a remotely running python, import this module and run the
following to create the connection

connect(machine="machinename",passwd='mypassword')

where "machinename" is the name of the machine where the original run
is. Note that the password must be the same as in the createmonitor
command. (The password provides some security since it is since using md5
encryption.  Though you should still probably not use a sensitive password!)
A "+++" prompt will be shown and commands typed will be sent to the remote job.

When the "+++" prompt is displayed, the remote job will stop execution
and wait for commands. To continue the job, type the control-d key.
