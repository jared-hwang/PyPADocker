where Enorm is the normal E field on the surface of the dual cell, that
extends from i-1/2 to i+1/2.

 - conductors: a conductor or list of conductors which act as particle scrapers
               Note that each conductor MUST have a unique id.
 - inj_d: the location of the virtual surface away from the conductor surface. It is in units of
          the geometric mean of the grid cell sizes. It defaults to top.inj_d[0].
 - rnnmax: if set, is an upper bound to number of particles to inject per timestep per cell.
              Note in cylindrical geometry, it is the number injected per timestep per cell divided
              by r (which for a constant flux density is constant, since the cell volume is proportional to r)
 - relax: if set, it is the relaxation paramter for the injected number,
              rnn =  relax*rnn + (1.-relax)*rnn_old
 - includebadparticles=False: Sometimes, particles cannot be interpolated to the emitting surface.
                              Set this to true to include those particles (not recommended).
 - solvers=None: optional list of solvers to use when injecting particles. When not given,
                 the solvers returned by registeredsolvers will be used. If multiple solvers
                 are given, they must all have the same grid.
 - solvers_field=None: optional list of solvers used to get the E fields for newly injected particles.
                       If not specified, will default to solvers.
 - doloadrho=False: When true, loadrho is called for the solver. If solvers is given, it is assumed
                    that they are not registered solvers and that the charge density is not otherwise
                    loaded, and this defaults to True.

After an instance is created, additional conductors can be added by calling
the method registerconductors which takes either a conductor or a list of
conductors are an argument.
