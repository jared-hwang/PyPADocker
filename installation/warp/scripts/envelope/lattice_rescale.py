The functions listed below are included in this module.  To access more detailed documentation on a given function, enter either help(function_name) or doc(function_name) into the Python command line.

  - rescalefunc(): Overarching function.  Determines the scaling factor by which to multiply the lattice focusing strength to yield the target x- or y-plane undepressed phase advance, then resets lattice quantities appropriately.  Valid for target phase advances between 0 and 180 degrees.
  - rescale(): Multiplies all allocated top variables having to do with lattice focusing strength by scale factor a.
  - phasediff(): Temporarily resets lattice focusing strength, determines the corresponding value of x-plane undepressed phase advance, and returns the difference between this and the target x-plane phase advance.

    """
  Determines by bisection root-finding the scale factor by which to multiply the lattice focusing strength so as to achieve a target value (sigma0target: in degrees per period) of x- or y-plane phase advance (sigma0), then resets appropriate lattice parameters.  The x- or y-plane choice (plane) is user-set.  If the x-plane is chosen, the y-plane phase advance will be consistently modified and vice-versa.  Valid for target sigma0 values between 0 and 180 degrees.

  Arguments:
    - sigma0target: Desired value of undepressed phase advance in degrees
    - plane = 'x': Specifies sigma0target as an x-plane quantity
            = 'y': Specifies sigma0target as a  y-plane quantity
    - da = 0.1: Size by which to increase or decrease lattice strength scale to establish a bracket for root-finding
    - rftol = 1.e-16: Root find tolerance for lattice rescale
    - steps = 1000: Number of evenly spaced intervals per lattice period
    - error_stop = True: Stops the program if an error trap is tripped

  This package works by integrating principal orbit functions and root finding on a simple phase advance constraint equation.  The principal orbits are integrated using functions in the envelope matching package envmatch_KVinvariant.py.

  If the bisection root-finding scheme ventures into an area of parameter space corresponding to a complex undepressed phase advance, the program will print warning messages.  As long as the target undepressed phase advance is between 0 and 180 degrees, simple tests indicate that the program will still converge to the physical answer in spite of these warning messages.  However, the user is advised to check answers carefully in such exceptional situations.
