"""Pepper-pot style diagnostics
Module PepperGrid.py
by Rami A. Kishek
created: Mar. 7, 2002

Last Modified:  03/08/02

This module contains functions which can apply a variety of masks,
including a pepper-pot array, and grids with square holes.  The masks
are applied by removing particles in the 2-D code, but the boundary
conditions are not applied self-consistently.

Functions Available:
apply_pp    ... Pepper-pot
apply_grid  ... Rectangular Grid
